## Python Credit Score Prediction

This project focuses on predicting customer credit scores using Machine Learning techniques in Python.

The goal is to analyze a dataset of bank customers, perform data preprocessing, and train classification models to determine whether a customer has a poor, standard, or good credit score.

### 🚀 Technologies and Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

### 🧠 Machine Learning Concepts Applied
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Encoding categorical features with LabelEncoder
- Train-test split
- Classification models:
  - Decision Tree Classifier
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Model evaluation using accuracy
- Feature importance analysis

### 📊 Project Workflow
1. Load and explore the dataset
2. Preprocess and transform categorical data
3. Split data into training and testing sets
4. Train multiple Machine Learning models
5. Compare model performance
6. Predict credit scores for new customers

This project was developed for learning purposes and as part of a practical introduction to Machine Learning and data analysis using Python.
